**Tic Tac Toe Game**

I developed a responsive Tic Tac Toe game where two players can compete on the same device, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key features of the project include:

**Two-Player Mode:** The game supports two-player gameplay, allowing friends to take turns playing on the same device.

**Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

**User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface with a 3x3 grid, using simple yet appealing visual elements to enhance the gaming experience.

**Game Logic:** Implemented robust game logic using JavaScript, which checks for win conditions, detects draw scenarios, and manages player turns.

**Reset Button:** A convenient reset button to start a new game without refreshing the page, resetting the board instantly.
